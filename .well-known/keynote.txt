Oh hey, you actually found this file.

Let me guess — you thought I’d be dumb enough to leave something important here? Like a flag? A password? Seriously?

I mean, props for checking, but this isn’t your lucky day.

Here’s a tip: not everything that looks hidden is worth finding. Some things are just… here to waste your time. Like this.

You could keep digging. You might even find something. Or maybe you’re just chasing breadcrumbs I left to mess with you.

Either way, enjoy the rabbit hole. :)
