  <p>
    I’m Alya Thapa — a researcher, observer, and someone who’s a bit too
    obsessed with the subtle art of digital footprints. My work sits at the
    intersection of <strong>privacy, adversarial AI,</strong> and
    <strong>OSINT misdirection</strong>.

    I don’t speak at conferences. I don’t give interviews. And I’m not a fan of
    being Googled. Most of what’s out there about me is either outdated,
    intentionally vague, or something I left behind on purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    I grew up in Kathmandu, but I’ve moved around more times than I care to
    count. I've worked with people I can’t talk about, on projects that never
    officially existed. Let’s just say I prefer staying behind the scenes.

  <p>
    These days, I spend more time studying how people leak information without
    realizing it — and occasionally, I drop a trail to see who follows.

    What do I do for a living? Easy.<br />
